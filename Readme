Counter


By Christopher Nakayama

Description:

This application is designed to take a number string from the user, parse the string into an 
integer/number datatype, generate an output counting from 0 through the given number and output 
each count into a list that is shown to the user after they hit submit. There are special rules, 
though. If the number includes a "1", "2", or "3", the application will return a message in place 
of that number.

This application will:

Input from user and parse it to an integer
Input Example: "5"
Output Example: 5
Use for loop to push every number from 0 to the inputted number into an empty array
Input Example: 5
Output Example: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Use a forEach function to change numbers that include 1, 2 or 3 to a sentence string.
Input Example: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output Example: [0, "Beep!", "Boop", "Won't You Be My Neighbor, 4, 5"]
Append each element to ul and show list to user upon submit.
Clear list and provide new output upon every click of submit without need for page refresh.
